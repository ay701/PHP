an has a access modifier.
class A{
    public static $public_static = "can access from anywhere";
    protected static $protected_static = "can access from inheriting classes";
    private static $private_static = "can access only inside the class";
}
Depending the visibility you can access static variables.
//inside the class
    self::$variable_name;
    static::$variable_name;
//outside the class
    class_name::$variable_name;
Can change the value after declaration.
    self::$variable_name = "New Value";
    static::$variable_name = "New Value";
No need to initialize when declare.
    public static $variable_name; 
Normal variable declaration rules applied(ex: begins with $)
Can create inside a function.
    class A{
        function my_function(){
             static $val = 12;
             echo ++$val; //13
        }
    }
Constant

Always public cannot put access modifiers.
class A{
    const my_constant = "constant value";
    public const wrong_constant="wrong" // produce a parse error
}
Anywhere you can access constant.
//inside the class
    self::variable_name;
    static::variable_name;
//outside the class
    class_name::variable_name;
Cannot change the value after declaration.
self::variable_name = "cannot change"; //produce a parse error
Must initialize when declare.
class A{
    const my_constant = "constant value";// Fine
    const wrong_constant;// produce a parse error
}
Must not use $ in the beginning of the variable(Other variable rules applied).
 class A{
    const my_constant = "constant value";// Fine
    const $wrong_constant="wrong";// produce a parse error
}
Cannot declare inside a function.
